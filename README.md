# CleanedData-with-pandas
This pandas code cleans up the 2019 order data and creates the new excel file called CleanedData by doing the following:
  1. Removed order IDs XXXXXX
  2. Split Customer ID column into two i.e. CustomerID and Customer Name
  3. Changed data type of CustomerID column to integer
  4. Rearranged the columns
  5. Created a new computed column i.e. Lead Time
  6. Sorted data by Order Date column in ascending order
